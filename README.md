## Installation

You can install `directus-config-toolkit` globally using npm:

```

Alternatively, add it to your project's dependencies:

```bash
npm install directus-config-toolkit --save-dev
```

## Usage

After installation, the tool provides several commands to manage your Directus configurations.

### Environment Variables

Set the following environment variables to configure the tool:

- `DIRECTUS_CT_URL`: The URL of your Directus instance.
- `DIRECTUS_CT_TOKEN`: The API token for authentication.
- `DIRECTUS_CT_CONFIG_PATH`: The path to your configuration files (defaults to `./config`).

You can set these variables in your shell or define them in a `.env` file in your project root.

### Commands

The toolkit supports the following commands:

- `export <type>`: Export the specified configuration type.

Replace `<type>` with one of the following configuration types:

- `flows`: Includes flows and operations.
- `roles`: Includes roles, permissions, and access.
- `settings`: Includes global settings.
- `files`: Includes files and folders. Only items with the `shouldBackup` field set to `true` are backed up; ensure this field is added to the collection.

```

Import roles configuration:

```bash
directus-ct import roles
```
